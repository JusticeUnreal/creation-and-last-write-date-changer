# creation-and-last-write-date-changer
## A short Windows PowerShell script to provide the change of creation and last write dates in every file inside of a specific folder.

This is basically all you need to know. You need to change the path and dates to the ones you need inside of the .ps1 file before running it.
## You may also need to change your policy in PowerShell in order to execute the script. 

**Type `Get-ExecutionPolicy` in your PowerShell window. If you see `Restricted`, then run this command: `Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned`**

**Don't forget to change it back to `Restricted` when you're done: `Set-ExecutionPolicy Restricted`. _Remember about your device's safety_.**
